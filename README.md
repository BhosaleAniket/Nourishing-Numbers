# Introduction

## Introduction and Question Identification

### Dataset Introduction

Provide an introduction to your dataset, including its source and general description.

### Question Identification

Clearly state the one question your project is centered around. Explain why readers should care about this question.

### Dataset Details

Report the number of rows in the dataset, the names of the columns that are relevant to your question, and descriptions of those relevant columns.


# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data Cleaning

### Data Cleaning Steps

Describe, in detail, the data cleaning steps you took and how they affected your analyses. 

### Cleaned DataFrame

Show the head of your cleaned DataFrame.

## Univariate Analysis

### Distribution Plots

Embed at least one plotly plot displaying the distribution of a single column. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot.

## Bivariate Analysis

### Relationship Plots

Embed at least one plotly plot displaying the relationship between two columns. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot.

## Interesting Aggregates

### Grouped/Pivot Table

Embed at least one grouped table or pivot table and explain its significance.

# Step 3: Assessment of Missingness

## NMAR Analysis

### NMAR Explanation

State whether you believe there is a column in your dataset that is NMAR. Explain your reasoning and any additional data you might want to obtain that could explain the missingness.

## Missingness Dependency

### Missingness Permutation Tests

Present and interpret the results of your missingness permutation tests with respect to your data and question. Embed a plotly plot related to your missingness exploration.

# Step 4: Hypothesis Testing

## Hypothesis Testing

### Hypotheses and Test

Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, your choice of test statistic and significance level, the resulting p-value, and your conclusion.

### Visualization (Optional)

Embed a visualization related to your hypothesis test if applicable.


# Step 5: Framing a Prediction Problem

## Problem Identification

### Prediction Problem

Clearly state your prediction problem and type (classification or regression). Report the response variable and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics.


# Step 6: Baseline Model

## Baseline Model

### Model Description

Describe your model and state the features in your model, including how many are quantitative, ordinal, and nominal, and how you performed any necessary encodings.

### Model Performance

Report the performance of your model and whether or not you believe your current model is “good” and why.

# Step 7: Final Model

## Final Model

### Feature Engineering

State the features you added and why they are good for the data and prediction task.

### Modeling Algorithm and Hyperparameters

Describe the modeling algorithm you chose, the hyperparameters that performed the best, and the method you used to select hyperparameters.

### Model Performance

Describe how your Final Model’s performance is an improvement over your Baseline Model’s performance.

### Visualization (Optional)

Include a visualization that describes your model’s performance, e.g., a confusion matrix, if applicable.

# Step 8: Fairness Analysis

## Fairness Analysis

### Fairness Evaluation

Perform a “fairness analysis” of your Final Model. Clearly state your null and alternative hypotheses, your choice of test statistic, and the results of your permutation test. 

### Conclusion

Interpret the results and explain any implications related to the fairness of your model.
